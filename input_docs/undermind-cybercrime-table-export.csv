1,100,Research on Cybercrime Prevention and Control Strategies Based on K-means++ and PSO Algorithm,2025,,"Jiaxing Lv, Yu Ji, Jianli Zhang",": This paper focuses on the field of cybercrime, analysing its global pattern and the effectiveness of policy responses through a multimethod approach. The World Cybercrime Index (WCI) is constructed with the help of experts' experience, which reveals the characteristics of the global cybercrime risk distribution, i.e. Europe and North America have a high prevalence of cybercrime, followed by Asia, and South America and Africa have a low prevalence of cybercrime. The K-means++ clustering algorithm is used to classify the risk of 97 countries/regions, and the results match the actual distribution. In the research of policy effectiveness, we constructed a performance score index and found that there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between cybercrime risk and the level of cybersecurity construction; we defined the security index S, and constructed a regression model by combining the political data and legal density of the ITU, and concluded that the legal measures are the most effective in improving the security index. The particle swarm optimisation algorithm is used to explore the optimal political scenarios, provide decision-making reference for legislators, and analyse the reasons for the differences in legal density, and the research results have important reference value for the formulation of global cybercrime prevention and control policies.",Journal of Electronics and Information Science,0,0,10.23977/jeis.2025.100106,https://doi.org/10.23977/jeis.2025.100106,,FALSE,,6348b1e4efec38e283abf9a6cf543106328e1d92,"- **Provides global cybercrime prevalence metrics and evaluates countermeasure effectiveness using algorithms.**  
- Constructs the World Cybercrime Index (WCI) to analyze global risk patterns and develops a security index (S) to assess policy impacts.

2,81.8,Victims of cybercrime in Europe: a review of victim surveys,2018,04/04/2018,"C. M. M. Reep-van den Bergh, M. Junger","Review the evidence provided by victim surveys in order to provide a rough estimate of the personal crime prevalence of the main types of cybercrime. We performed a search in databases, searched online, and contacted several Offices for National Statistics in Europe and selected surveys that provided information about individual victims of crime which were representative for a general population. Six types of cybercrime have been distinguished, namely online shopping fraud, online fraud banking/payment, other cyber fraud (such as advanced fee fraud), cyber threats/harassment, malware, and hacking. For every survey the questions on cybercrime are presented and the crime prevalence estimates are compared. Nine surveys were included. Annual crime prevalence rates ranged from 1 to 3% for online shopping fraud, from less than 1 to 2% for online banking/payment fraud. Less than 1% of the population is a victim of other types of fraud and a maximum of 3% of the population experiences some sort of online bullying such as stalking (1%) or threatening (1%). 1–6% is a victim of hacking. The estimates for being a victim of malware range from 2 to 15%. For all offences it cannot be estimated how much of the differences are due to variation in methods and questioning between the studies or real differences between countries or change over time. As yet there have been very few well performed randomised sampled studies on cybercrime amongst the general population. Cybercrime prevalence (and its trend) can only be well measured if the questions are frequently updated and adequately address new aspects of cybercrime. To adequately monitor cybercrime in the future it is advisable to develop some fairly abstract main categories that are of durable validity, whilst allowing for up-to-date illustrations. Furthermore, ideally the questioning in the ongoing surveys in the different countries should be standardised and there should be a uniform categorisation of the different cyber offences. A screening question in order to permit more accurate dating is essential to reduce telescoping bias. Surveys should ask about the impact on or damage to the victims.",Crime Science,74,10.6,10.1186/s40163-018-0079-3,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40163-018-0079-3,,TRUE,"{'url': 'https://crimesciencejournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40163-018-0079-3', 'status': 'GOLD'}",a24884fe677e78fe21c94fdac33bc654f79af12d,"- **Provides prevalence estimates for specific types of cybercrime using victim surveys.**

3,81,Enhancing the effectiveness of cybercrime prevention through policy monitoring,2019,20/10/2019,Benoît Dupont,"ABSTRACT This article examines the feasibility of designing and implementing a cybercrime prevention monitoring approach to enhance the quality of knowledge about policies that aim to reduce the prevalence and impact of online harms. Despite very significant investments made by governments over the past decade to improve the cybersecurity of publicly and privately-operated computer systems, there is very limited systematic knowledge about what cybercrime prevention policies have been adopted in various parts of the world and even less knowledge about their effectiveness in reducing the exposure of individuals and organizations to cybercrime. Borrowing from the policy monitoring (or policy surveillance) methodology that was developed in a broad range of fields such as public health and education, this article argues that such an approach would be critical in advancing our understanding of what is being done to control cybercrime, what works, what doesn’t, and what is promising. This article provides an overview of the principles and benefits of the policy monitoring approach, reviews the main features of a sample of 18 policy monitoring platforms, assesses a dozen cybersecurity policy rating initiatives—concluding that very few of them include cybercrime in their framework, then provides a template for the creation of a dedicated cybercrime prevention monitoring tool that would benefit academics, policy-makers and practitioners.",Journal of Crime and Justice,17,3.1,10.1080/0735648x.2019.1691855,https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648x.2019.1691855,,FALSE,,94055228e65041e4b62dbddcb885c79335deafb3,"- **Provides a framework for monitoring cybercrime prevention policies globally.**

4,79.4,Mapping the global geography of cybercrime with the World Cybercrime Index,2024,10/04/2024,"Miranda Bruce, Jonathan Lusthaus, Ridhi Kashyap, Nigel Phair, Federico Varese","Cybercrime is a major challenge facing the world, with estimated costs ranging from the hundreds of millions to the trillions. Despite the threat it poses, cybercrime is somewhat an invisible phenomenon. In carrying out their virtual attacks, offenders often mask their physical locations by hiding behind online nicknames and technical protections. This means technical data are not well suited to establishing the true location of offenders and scholarly knowledge of cybercrime geography is limited. This paper proposes a solution: an expert survey. From March to October 2021 we invited leading experts in cybercrime intelligence/investigations from across the world to participate in an anonymized online survey on the geographical location of cybercrime offenders. The survey asked participants to consider five major categories of cybercrime, nominate the countries that they consider to be the most significant sources of each of these types of cybercrimes, and then rank each nominated country according to the impact, professionalism, and technical skill of its offenders. The outcome of the survey is the World Cybercrime Index, a global metric of cybercriminality organised around five types of cybercrime. The results indicate that a relatively small number of countries house the greatest cybercriminal threats. These findings partially remove the veil of anonymity around cybercriminal offenders, may aid law enforcement and policymakers in fighting this threat, and contribute to the study of cybercrime as a local phenomenon.",PLOS ONE,13,13.3,10.1371/journal.pone.0297312,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0297312,,TRUE,"{'url': 'https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0297312&type=printable', 'status': 'GOLD'}",a746f98a53072d8a8758dd11aa53951b7320ffdd,"- Provides a global metric for cybercriminal activity by geography.

5,75.9,Pattern Analysis of Cyber Crime Incidents to Predict Occurrence and Selection of The Best Technology to Prevent IT,2024,08/11/2024,"Sudhesh Kumar, Prof. Dr. Minni Sinha","Cybercrime has become a significant global threat, affecting individuals, organizations, and governments alike. This research paper focuses on the pattern analysis of cyber crime incidents and aims to develop a predictive model to forecast its occurrence while selecting the most effective technology for prevention. Through an extensive literature review, we analyze existing research on cybercrime patterns, predictive modeling, and technologies for prevention. The study identifies the gaps in the current literature, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive approach that combines data-driven analysis with advanced cybersecurity technologies. The research methodology encompasses data collection from diverse sources, followed by rigorous data preprocessing and cleaning to ensure data quality. Machine learning algorithms and statistical methods are utilized for developing the predictive model. Evaluation metrics are employed to measure the model's performance and its ability to predict cybercrime incidents accurately. The pattern analysis of cybercrime incidents reveals various attack vectors, target sectors, and geographical distributions, providing crucial insights into the modus operandi of cybercriminals. This analysis forms the basis for building the predictive model, which can assist law enforcement agencies and cybersecurity professionals in anticipating and preventing cybercrime effectively. The findings of this research contribute significantly to the field of cybercrime prevention. The developed predictive model enhances early warning capabilities, enabling proactive measures against cyber threats. Additionally, the technology selection framework assists organizations in making informed decisions regarding cybersecurity investments.","International Journal of Scientific Research in Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology",0,0,10.32628/cseit241061104,https://doi.org/10.32628/cseit241061104,,TRUE,"{'url': 'https://ijsrcseit.com/index.php/home/article/download/CSEIT241061104/CSEIT241061104', 'status': 'GOLD'}",38fb894ba60533ad60d960735ad081883404475a,#NAME?

Redmiles","We know surprisingly little about the prevalence and severity of cybercrime in the U.S. Yet, in order to prioritize the development and distribution of advice and technology to protect end users, we require empirical evidence regarding cybercrime. Measuring crime, including cybercrime, is a challenging problem that relies on a combination of direct crime reports to the government – which have known issues of under-reporting – and assessment via carefully-designed self-report surveys. We report on the first large-scale, nationally representative academic survey (n=11,953) of consumer cybercrime experiences in the U.S. Our analysis answers four research questions: (1) What is the prevalence and (2) the monetary impact of these cybercrimes we measure in the U.S.?, (3) Do inequities exist in victimization?, and (4) Can we improve cybercrime measurement by leveraging social-reporting techniques used to measure physical crime?

7,70.9,Evolving Legal Responses to Cybercrime: Bridging Regulatory Gaps in the Digital Age,2024,10/10/2024,,"This research examines the law enforcement response to cybercrime from 2020 to 2024, focusing on its trends, growth, and regional regulatory gaps. A mixed-methods approach was adopted, analyzing twenty research papers and legislative frameworks in countries like Russia, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Brazil through analytical and comparative legal methods. Findings reveal that only 23% of regions have implemented modern cybercrime regulations, with most still relying on outdated laws from the 1970s. From 2007 to 2013, approximately seven million cyber offenses led to 900,000 investigations. The study identified six significant gaps in current systems, highlighting the correlation between updated legislation and enforcement success. Regions with modern cybercrime laws saw a 45% increase in prosecution rates compared to those without. The research also introduces a classification system for cybercrimes into seven categories (CC 01 to CC 07). Additionally, it explores the role of blockchain technology in cybercrime prosecution, noting a 34% improvement in tracking cryptocurrency-related offenses in regions utilizing blockchain forensic techniques.

8,62.8,Reviewing Estimates of Cybercrime Victimisation and Cyber Risk Likelihood,2022,01/06/2022,"Daniel W. Woods, Lukas Walter","Across both the public and private sector, cyberse-curity decisions could be informed by estimates of the likelihood of different types of exploitation and the corresponding harms. Law enforcement should focus on investigating and disrupting those cybercrimes that are relatively more frequent, all else being equal. Similarly, firms should account for the likelihood of different forms of cyber incident when tailoring risk management policies. This paper reviews the quantitative evidence available for both cybercrime victimi-sation and cyber risk likelihood, providing a bridge between the academic fields of criminology and cybersecurity. We extract estimates from 48 studies conducted by a mix of academics, statistical institutes, and cybersecurity vendors using a range of data sources including victim surveys, case-control studies, and the insurance market. The victimisation estimates are categorised into: cyber attack; malware; ran-somware; fraudulent email; online banking fraud; online sales fraud; unauthorised access; Denial of Service; and identity theft. For each category, we display all estimates in the years 2017–2021. Our review shows: (i) firms face higher victimisation rates than individuals, which increases in the number of employees; (ii) global surveys reveal a consistent relative ranking of countries in ransomware victimisation; (iii) although trends could be identified within studies that collect longitudinal data, these trends tended to contradict each other when compared across studies; and (iv) broad categories with unclear consequences (e.g. malware and fraudulent emails) displayed higher variance and average values than categories associated with specific outcomes (e.g. identity theft or online banking fraud).

we report what has changed in the seven years since. The period has seen major platform 
evolution, with the mobile phone replacing the PC and laptop as the consumer terminal 
of choice, with Android replacing Windows, and with many services moving to the cloud. 
The use of social networks has become extremely widespread. The executive summary is 
that about half of all property crime, by volume and by value, is now online. We hypothesised 
in 2012 that this might be so; it is now established by multiple victimisation studies. 
Many cybercrime patterns appear to be fairly stable, but there are some interesting changes. 
Payment fraud, for example, has more than doubled in value but has fallen slightly as a 
proportion of payment value; the payment system has simply become bigger, and slightly 
more ecient. Several new cybercrimes are signicant enough to mention, including business 
email compromise and crimes involving cryptocurrencies. The move to the cloud means that 
system misconguration may now be responsible for as many breaches as phishing. Some 
companies have suered large losses as a side-eect of denial-of-service worms released by 
state actors, such as NotPetya; we have to take a view on whether they count as cybercrime. 
The infrastructure supporting cybercrime, such as botnets, continues to evolve, and specic 
crimes such as premium-rate phone scams have evolved some interesting variants. The overall 
picture is the same as in 2012: traditional oences that are now technically `computer 
crimes' such as tax and welfare fraud cost the typical citizen in the low hundreds of Euros/ 
dollars a year; payment frauds and similar oences, where the modus operandi has been 
completely changed by computers, cost in the tens; while the new computer crimes cost in 
the tens of cents. Defending against the platforms used to support the latter two types of 
crime cost citizens in the tens of dollars. Our conclusions remain broadly the same as in 2012: 
it would be economically rational to spend less in anticipation of cybercrime (on antivirus, 
rewalls, etc.) and more on response. We are particularly bad at prosecuting criminals who 
operate infrastructure that other wrongdoers exploit. Given the growing realisation among 
policymakers that crime hasn't been falling over the past decade, merely moving online, we 
might reasonably hope for better funded and coordinated law-enforcement action.",,100,17.1,10.17863/CAM.41598,https://doi.org/10.17863/CAM.41598,,FALSE,,b401cbd749835a637cc4903a48b18c6699cf8787,"- **Provides updated insights on the cost-and-volume metrics of cybercrime.**

Knijnenburg, Jens Grossklags, Brad Wardman","Reporting plays a vital role in combatting cyber-crimes. The data collected from cybercrime reporting can not only bolster the efforts of those on the responding end of such attacks (i.e., government, law enforcement agencies, and the technology industry), but also provide relevant prevention tips to computer users to help mitigate their cybercrime risk. Despite the importance of cybercrime reporting, we observe that many cybercrimes go unreported, which arguably can be due to an overall lack of effectiveness of currently existing cybercrime reporting mechanisms. This study aims to streamline cybercrime reporting processes at PayPal by proposing a design of an interactive customer-facing cybercrime reporting interface. The overall goals of the proposed design are to (1) appropriately triage reports both within the company and to relevant external entities and (2) to educate the customer base about cybercrimes and cybercrime reporting through helpful links.

Coopamootoo","Despite the increasing prevalence of cybercrimes, there is limited understanding of the response strategies and protective (privacy, security) practices of individuals who have experienced at least one attempted or successful cybercrime incident. To address this gap, we conduct an online survey across an N=605 sample from the UK, eliciting firsthand accounts of cybercrime experiences, actions taken in response to such incidents, as well as their level of engagement with security and privacy (SP) methods and technologies. We identify the occurrence of 8 distinct types of cybercrime and 9 corresponding response strategies amongst 319 cybercrime reports, encompassing IT and protective themes. We depict the association between the experience of cybercrime and the utilisation of response strategies through visual representation. In parallel with IT-related or protective SP theme response strategies, we find that the type of cybercrime experienced (e.g., malware) and the frequency of experiences (e.g., multiple cybercrimes or repeated experiences of the same cybercrime type) influence the engagement with SP technologies. This paper provides empirical insights into experiences of different types of cybercrimes, including their multiple occurrences, and (protective) actions.

Voce, Anthony Morgan","This is the first report in the Cybercrime in Australia series, which aims to provide a clearer picture of the extent of cybercrime victimisation, help-seeking and harms among Australian computer users. It is based on a survey of 13,887 computer users conducted in early 2023. In the 12 months prior to the survey, 27 percent of respondents had been a victim of online abuse and harassment, 22 percent had been a victim of malware, 20 percent had been a victim of identity crime and misuse, and eight percent had been a victim of fraud and scams. Overall, 47 percent of respondents experienced at least one cybercrime in the 12 months prior to the survey—and nearly half of all victims reported experiencing more than one type of cybercrime. Thirty-four percent of respondents had experienced a data breach. Cybercrime victimisation was not evenly distributed, with certain sections of the community more likely to have been a victim, and certain online activities associated with a higher likelihood of victimisation. Most cybercrime victimisation went unreported to police or to ReportCyber, meaning official statistics significantly underestimate the size of the problem. Satisfaction with the outcomes of these reports was mixed, and relatively few reports resulted in an offender being apprehended. Rates of help-seeking varied and were influenced by the perceived seriousness of cybercrime and knowledge of how and where to report it. The financial losses experienced by victims were wide ranging. Some victims reported losing large sums of money, but most victims reported relatively small financial losses. This report measures, for the first time, the harms experienced by individual victims and small businesses that extend beyond these financial costs. Twenty-five percent of respondents were negatively impacted by cybercrime in the 12 months prior to the survey, while 22 percent of respondents who owned or operated a small to medium business said their business was negatively impacted by cybercrime.",Journal Not Provided,1,0.6,10.52922/sr77031,https://doi.org/10.52922/sr77031,,FALSE,,e615bf83acb7e442833771181e6cdc8b807c9745,"- **Provides prevalence metrics for cybercrime victimization among Australian computer users.**

The development of these systems poses a significant challenge, since they have to be designed in a way to ensure cyber-security without impacting their performance. This article presents the Security Cost Modelling Framework (SCMF) and shows supported by an experimental study how it can be used to measure, normalise, and aggregate the overall performance of a CPS. Unlike previous studies, our approach uses different metrics to measure the overall performance of a CPS and provides a methodology for normalising the measurement results of different units to a common Cost Unit. Moreover, we show how the Security Costs can be extracted from the overall performance measurements, which allows us to quantify the overhead imposed by performing security-related tasks. Furthermore, we describe the architecture of our experimental testbed and demonstrate the applicability of SCMF in an experimental study.

It includes a review of the criminological debate on the crime drop, which shows that the exchanges between researchers allowed clarifying its extent and limits, but without reaching agreement about its causes and seldom taking into account the trends in cyber-related offences. The paper also reviews the data available on the latter and arrives to the conclusion that European police statistics rarely include them and, when they do, the available data do not allow establishing trends nor conducting comparisons across countries. The difficulties related to the recording of such crimes are discussed and a proposal for a tripartite classification of crimes that distinguishes between offline, online, and hybrid crimes is advanced, together with suggestions on the statistical counting rules that could be applied to measure the frequency of cyber-related offences. Finally, a review of the available victimization surveys shows that cybercrime could currently represent between one-third and half of the crimes committed in a country. Accordingly, the authors consider that the rise of online and hybrid crimes have contributed to the drop of offline crimes. This is a consequence of the development of the Internet, which changed the lifestyle and routine activities of the population, and opened a breach in traditional police-based crime prevention strategies.

Wall,"All too often claims about the prevalence of cybercrimes lack clarification as to what it is that is particularly ‘cyber’ about them. Perhaps more confusing is the startling contrast between the many hundreds of thousands of incidents of cybercrime supposedly reported each year and the relatively small number of known prosecutions. This contrasting evidence exposes a large gap in our understanding of cybercrime and begs a number of important questions about the quality of the production of criminological knowledge about it. For example, how reliable and partial are the informational sources that mould our opinions about cybercrime. Do we fully understand the epistemological differences between the various legal, academic, expert and popular (lay) constructions of cybercrime? Alternatively, is the criminal justice system just woefully inefficient at bringing wrongdoers to justice? Or are there still some major questions to be answered about the conceptual basis upon which information is gathered and assumptions about cybercrime made? This article takes a critical look at the way that public perceptions of cybercrime are shaped and insecurities about it are generated. It explores the varying conceptualisations of cybercrime before identifying tensions in the production of criminological knowledge that are causing the rhetoric to be confused with reality. It then contrasts the mythology of cybercrime with what is actually going on in order to understand the reassurance gap that has opened up between public demands for Internet security and its provision.","International Review of Law, Computers & Technology",93,5.4,10.1080/13600860801924907,https://doi.org/10.1080/13600860801924907,,FALSE,,2a91ba89104bd17f0dcf0e3cb26e7bbed3824362,

The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of cyber-attacks to the economy, to price the associated cost and to recommend possible measures that internet service providers (ISPs) and policy makers can apply in order to mitigate these risks. In order to achieve that, we employ insurance (actuarial) pricing techniques to calculate the cost of cyber-attacks for an individual and for the economy of a country in total. We are therefore at the same time in place to recommend insurance coverage solutions that can assist in protecting the entity of interest from cyber risks. This resembles to the calculation of a risk premium, as the premium is calculated taking into account only the probability of occurrence of a cyber-attack and the interest rate and not any other loadings.

Bruce, Nigel Phair","The acknowledgement that cybercrime offenders are embedded within local contexts presents a broad vector for further study. But research in this area is still in its early days and many topics need to be developed further. Foremost among these is the geography of cybercrime. This endeavour has an important policy contribution to make. For example, if we can determine which countries are producing cybercrime at more significant levels, preventative measures can be specifically targeted to those countries. The first step within such a research agenda must be the development of an index of cybercriminality by country, as this is foundational to identifying hubs of digital offending and the factors driving the emergence of these hubs. This paper is methodological in its contribution, and does not offer its own empirical findings. Instead, it aims to provide some broad foundational thinking for a very challenging research exercise, and it is intended to support later, more refined, efforts to develop indices. It consists of two components. First, it reviews existing attempts to identify and rank cybercrime hotspots. Second, it draws important lessons from these works towards developing a successful index.

Attackers have chosen strategies such as social engineering, phishing, and malware as part of their cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack can lead to various effects, ranging from stealing individual data to extortion money or losing helpful information. Society and systems depend on critical infrastructures like power plants, hospitals, and financial services companies. This paper analyzes financial losses statistics for cyber security and future trends. The cost of cybercrime prevention is increasing day by day. Financial losses refer to damages to the wealth of an organization. This includes organizational losses, compensation, and legal fees. By financial loss, we mean increased costs or reduced income caused by the threat. We collect data from various datasets and information from sources. After collecting data, we analyze the data and create a different chart to identify the growth of cyber-attacks, cyber security, and cybercrime costs. We analyze global and worldwide cybercrime status. We also investigate state-wise cybercrime and the cyber security status of the United States of America.

Kshetri,"Introduction The meteoric rise in cybercrime has been an issue of pressing concern to our society. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), nine out of 10 U.S. companies experienced computer security incidents in 2005 which led to a loss of $67.2 billion. A survey conducted by IBM found that U.S. businesses worry more about cybercrimes than about physical crimes. Internet-related frauds accounted for 46% of consumer complaints made to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2005. Total losses of Internet fraud victims reporting to FTC increased from $205 million in 2003 to $336 million in 2005. In a July 2007 interview with USA Today, McAfee CEO reported that his company received 3,000--5,000 threat submissions per day from customers and 10% of them were new. This paper offers an economic analysis to explain cybercrimes' escalation. We define cybercrimes as criminal activities in which computers or computer networks are the principal means of committing an offense. Examples include cyber-theft, cyber-trespass, cyber-obscenity, critical infrastructure attacks and cyber-extortions.6 The most notable features of the cybercrime environment include newness, technology and skill-intensiveness, and a high degree of globalization. Factors such as a wide online availability of hacking tools, information sharing in the cyber-criminal community, availability of experienced hackers' help to less skillful criminals and congestion in law enforcement systems produce externality effects within the cyber-criminal community as well as across society and businesses. We focus on three positive or self-reinforcing feedback systems to examine increasing returns in cybercrime related activities. In this article, we first provide an overview of the positive feedback loops that reinforce cyber-criminals' behavior.

More recently, the concept of 'organized crime' has been attributed to cyber criminality. There has been subsequent disagreement and confusion concerning whether such crime is a derivation of traditional organized crime or an evolution of such crime within the online space. This paper analyses the opaque state of affairs which has been exacerbated by the relative lack of clear evidence attesting to and supporting either scenario. Technological advances have always been used to the advantage of the criminal fraternity. The crucial question that remains is whether those advances have merely facilitated the commission of physical crime or whether in fact they have led to the creation of a new wave of traditional, but virtual, organized crime.

The telecommunications sector has established cyberspace, a virtual domain for online communication, data exchange, and digital interactions. This platform enables individuals to interact and cultivate relationships worldwide, fostering a sense of proximity despite geographical separation. Nonetheless, these improvements provide concerns, since there has been an increase in cyber victimisation via cyberspace, the internet, computer networks, and online systems. Criminals are progressively utilising these technologies to perpetrate illicit actions, endangering individuals, governments, organisations, and institutions.This study analyses the evaluation of cyber policies for regulating, monitoring, and supervising cyberspace activities, along with the implementation of cybersecurity measures to address technologically advanced crime. A mixed methods strategy, including qualitative and quantitative methodologies, was employed for data collecting. The research revealed that although cyberspace provides avenues for social contact, idea exchange, information dissemination, commercial transactions, and additional activities, it remains susceptible to cyber threats including ransomware, fraud, warfare, terrorism, trafficking, and breaches of privacy. Formulating cyber regulations to regulate actions in cyberspace is crucial for efficient law enforcement, alongside the establishment of a cybersecurity framework to safeguard critical cyber systems and bolster security protocols across several sectors. To safeguard both the public and private sectors against cybersecurity risks, it is essential to create and execute plans. These tactics encompass the regular evaluation and auditing of security systems, investment in cybersecurity training programs, maintenance of current systems, formulation and rehearsal of incident response plans, and dissemination of information among experts and professionals.",International Journal of Business Ecosystem &amp; Strategy (2687-2293),0,0,10.36096/ijbes.v6i5.670,https://doi.org/10.36096/ijbes.v6i5.670,,TRUE,"{'url': 'https://doi.org/10.36096/ijbes.v6i5.670', 'status': 'GOLD'}",1cbaae577c4703cbe6c165bb525b421d3f52503b,

Much research has focused on high cybercrime countries, but this research is often conducted by cybersecurity firms and is exclusively descriptive, making no inferences. This research sought to determine what characteristics predict whether a nation is high in either spamming activity or phishing activity. In a sample of 132 countries, it was found that wealthier nations with more Internet users per capita had higher cybercrime activity.

Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to review current evidence in relation to scale and impacts of cyber crime, including various approaches to defining and measuring the problem.


Design/methodology/approach
A review and analysis of survey evidence is used to enable an understanding of the scope and scale of the cyber crime problem, and its effect upon those experiencing it.


Findings
The analysis evidences that cyber crime exists in several dimensions, with costs and harms that can be similarly varied. There is also a sense that, moving forward, the “cyber” label will become somewhat redundant as many crimes have the potential to have a technology component.


Research limitations/implications
The key evidence in this particular discussion has some geographic limitations, with much of the discussion focussed upon data drawn from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, as well as other UK-based sources. However, many of the broader points still remain more widely relevant.


Practical implications
This study helps in: better understanding the range and scale of cyber crime threats; understanding how the cyber element fits into the wider context of crime; improving the appreciation of what cyber crime can mean for potential victims; and recognising the cost dimensions, and the implications for protection and response.


Social implications
The discussion will help businesses and individuals to have a better appreciation of the cyber crime threat, and what ought to be considered in response to it.


Originality/value
The discussion is based upon recent evidence, and therefore represents a more up-to-date view of the cyber crime landscape than reviews already available in earlier literature.

Drew, Lucy C Farrell","ABSTRACT The prevalence and impact of cyber fraud continues to increase exponentially with new and more innovative methods developed by offenders to target and exploit victims for their own financial reward. Traditional crime reaction methods used by police have proved largely ineffective in this context, with offenders typically located outside of the police jurisdiction of their victims. Given this, some police agencies have begun to adopt a victim focused, crime prevention approach to cyber fraud. The current research explores with a sample of two hundred and eighteen potential cyber fraud victims, the relationship between online victimization risk, knowledge and use of crime prevention strategies. The study found those most at risk of cyber fraud victimization despite accurate perceptions of risk and knowledge of self-protective behaviors in the online environment underutilise online prevention strategies. This research has important implications for police agencies who are designing and delivering cyber fraud education.

The survey reveals that next to malware infection and theft of IT equipment, hacking is the most commonly reported computer crime incident. The findings also document that there are large differences in security practices between large and small enterprises, even when it comes to measures one would have thought that all enterprises independent of size would have implemented. This practice may put small enterprises in a position of high risk. This is also worrying in a national context as small enterprises make up the majority of the total number of enterprises.

However, although several scientific disciplines have commonly employed criminological theories to explain this phenomenon, mainstream criminology has devoted relatively scant attention to the investigation of cyber-criminals and their victims. Drawing on this assumption that more criminological attention should be given to this important type of crime, this article presents an interdisciplinary review of the current state of research on cyber-dependent crimes (i.e., crimes that require the use of computer technology to exist, such as hacking). We begin with a brief discussion of the ecosystem of cyber-dependent crimes and the key actors who operate within it, including the online offenders and enablers, targets and victims, and guardians. Next, we review empirical scholarship that pertains to each actor while distinguishing between nontheoretical research and theoretically driven studies. We then detail methodological and theoretical avenues that should be pursued by future research and discuss why criminological research should lead policy initiatives and guide the design of technical tools that improve the scientific community's ability to generate a safer and more secure cyber-environment.

Innovations and technological advancements aimed at moving the world towards a digital age increase the risks of cybercrime. Concurrently, as the risk of cybercrime increases so does the challenge to police it. The policing of cybercrime is generally an afterthought for several organisations and individuals in South Africa. This type of crime has no regional, national or international boundaries, unlike “traditional crime” which has physical boundaries and limits in relation to jurisdiction. This contributes towards the challenge of detecting, investigating and combating it. Cyber criminals have intercepted vital and essential government, personal and business information online. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to explore the obstacles/challenges that hamper the effective and efficient policing of cybercrime in Durban, South Africa. A qualitative research approach was adopted, to explore the challenges of policing of cybercrime in the study area. The findings collected through semi-structured interviews with a total number of twenty (20) participants comprising of SAPS Directorate for Priority Crime Investigation (DPCI) officials, members of Bowline Security and members of the Durban community; suggest that there is a shortage of SAPS officials who are knowledgeable in handling cybercrime related cases. Policies and strategies to police cybercrime in Durban are insufficient because of the lack of resources, to adequately implement policy and promote cooperative strategic partnerships.

Until they are removed, the fraudsters learn the passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs) and other personal details of the users who are fooled into visiting them. We analyse empirical data on phishing website removal times and the number of visitors that the websites attract, and conclude that website removal is part of the answer to phishing, but it is not fast enough to completely mitigate the problem. The removal times have a good fit to a lognormal distribution, but within the general pattern there is ample evidence that some service providers are faster than others at removing sites, and that some brands can get fraudulent sites removed more quickly. We particularly examine a major subset of phishing websites (operated by the 'rock-phish' gang) which accounts for around half of all phishing activity and whose architectural innovations have extended their average lifetime.

The main goal is to investigate how various financial and business-related cybercrime parameters relate to cybersecurity costs. In this context, the paper also examines the involved stakeholders and how they interact with each other. Methods/Analysis: Given the above considerations, from a theoretical standpoint, it is to describe a generic model for pricing illicit cybercrime products and services. This model, namely the Capacity Value Based Pricing (CVBP) model, has been proposed in the context of pricing “normal” products and services. Our study adapts this model suitably to apply the pricing modeling of illicit cybercrime products and services. Findings: The findings elucidate the professionalization of cybercrime, the significance of the emerging market for illicit services, and the pressing need for advanced AI methods to process qualitative data into quantitative insights. Novelty/Improvement:This paper contributes to establishing theoretical and econometric models vital for stakeholders navigating the financial terrain of the cybercrime economy.

Zee","PurposeCybercrime rates have increased rapidly during the last couple of decades, resulting in cybercrimes becoming common crimes. However, most victims do not report cybercrimes to the police. Therefore, this study examines reporting cybercrime victimization and provides insights into the role of the police in this process.Design/methodology/approachA sample of 595 individuals was used. All respondents were shown three vignettes about hypothetical cybercrime victimization and were asked to imagine that this situation happened to them. Four crime and reporting characteristics were manipulated across vignettes. Respondents' intentions to report to the police and to other organizations were used as the dependent variables in regression analyses. Four random factors in the vignettes (i.e. type of crime, seriousness of crime, victim–perpetrator relationship, and reporting modality), as well as several characteristics of the respondents were included in the regression models as independent variables.FindingsThe type of cybercrime is the most important predictor for reporting behaviors. Other determinants are: more serious offenses were more often reported and offenses are less often reported in situations where the victim personally knows the perpetrator. Furthermore, there is large discrepancy between intended and actual cybercrime reporting. These findings provide valuable insights into the factors that influence reporting behavior in the real world. Only a fifth of respondents indicated that they would not report cybercrime victimization to the police. This implies that attempts at improving reporting rates should not solely be focused on improving people's attitudes, but also on removing obstacles to turn these attitudes into actions.Originality/valueIn the current study, the authors contribute to the existing literature by asking a large sample from the general population in the Netherlands about both their intended reporting behavior (i.e. a vignette study) and their actual reporting behavior (i.e. self-reports) of victimization of a wide variety of different types of cybercrime. Determinants of both reporting to the police as well as to other organizations are examined. Moreover, respondents are asked about motivations behind their decision to (not) report a cybercrime to the police.

Research on cybercrime victimization has exploded in the past few years, but much of it relies on convenience samples and is largely descriptive in nature. The research presented here involves the collection of data from a large sample of Virginia households in 2022 (n = 1,206). The data are analyzed to provide a partial test of routine activity theory to better understand fraud and theft via the Internet. The data provide a solid baseline for describing the extent of cyber victimization across the state. Bivariate and multivariate analyses (logistic regressions) show support for routine activity theory and provide important insights for future research. In particular, we find that certain routine Internet activities may better predict unique forms of cybervictimization than others and that length of time on the Internet is not a good indicator of exposure to motivated offenders. Further, protective guardianship mediates the effects of exposure to motivated offenders; thus, efforts to educate the public on best practices are needed. We conclude that to better assess cybercrime, victimization and engagement, better measurement and longitudinal panel data will be needed.",Criminal Justice Studies,0,0,10.1080/1478601X.2023.2254094,https://doi.org/10.1080/1478601X.2023.2254094,,FALSE,,dcab89e08a235a889d5a46a37167ead8a268eaa4,

Moore","Cybercrime is a pervasive threat for today's Internet-dependent society. While the real extent and economic impact is hard to quantify, scientists and officials agree that cybercrime is a huge and still growing problem. A substantial fraction of cybercrime's overall costs to society can be traced to indirect opportunity costs, resulting from unused online services. This paper presents a parsimonious model that builds on technology acceptance research and insights from criminology to identify factors that reduce Internet users' intention to use online services. We hypothesize that avoidance of online banking, online shopping and online social networking is increased by cybercrime victimization and media reports. The effects are mediated by the perceived risk of cybercrime and moderated by the user's confidence online. We test our hypotheses using a structural equation modeling analysis of a representative pan-European sample. Our empirical results confirm the negative impact of perceived risk of cybercrime on the use of all three online service categories and support the role of cybercrime experience as an antecedent of perceived risk of cybercrime. We further show that more confident Internet users perceive less cybercriminal risk and are more likely to use online banking and online shopping, which highlights the importance of consumer education.",IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing,62,6.8,10.1109/TDSC.2015.2410795,https://doi.org/10.1109/TDSC.2015.2410795,,FALSE,,d5e4c09d774e374780b5acff2213dbb0756bd29b,

More complex questions have arisen concerning the validity and reliability of victim survey data, including whether they can be used in cross‐national comparisons of crime and criminal justice issues. Victim survey data are sufficiently valid and reliable for use in cross‐national comparisons. Victim surveys can tell us a great deal about crime cross‐nationally that police administrative data cannot. While surveys in principle should be more comparable across nations than police administrative data, in practice this comparability cannot be assumed. Self‐consciously comparative surveys, such as the International Crime Victimization Survey (ICVS) produce more comparable data across nations than nation‐specific surveys do.

An important substrata of this literature focuses on placing a monetary value on the costs of cyber crime but little is known about the long-term economic impact to society. In this article, we first assess the shortcomings of existing cost estimates and focus on the relevant issues pertinent to the feasibility of deriving valid and useful estimates beyond cost-benefit analyses. Following a mixed top-down/bottom-up methodology, we propose a theoretical framework to systematically identify the short and long-term impacts of cyber crime both at the agent and societal level.

Cybercrime is one of the new forms or dimensions of today's crimes gaining widespread attention internationally. Utilization of computer technology continues to evolve has led to the process of convergence between information technology, media and communications to ultimately produce a new tool known as the Internet, as well as the beginning of the birth of civilization in cyberspace. Data is a form of jama from datum, derived from Latin meaning ""given something"". At present, information is a very decisive medium for the economic development of a country both developing and developed countries. Information about individuals is always administered by government and private, but the advent of the computer age creates a greater threat to the privacy of the individual, as well as the likelihood of individuals suffering losses as a result of inattention or leakage of information will be much greater. It should be noted, however, that in the cybercrime world, the majority of illegal access to computer systems or networks is used as a first step towards actions that lead to other forms of cybercrime. In this paper the author discusses about how electronic data protection as a cybercrime in the era of globalization today and how the criminal policy formulation review in an effort to protect electronic data.

The growing penetration of internet services, the expansion of e-commerce, and the rapid adoption of digital payment systems have made individuals and organizations more vulnerable to cyber threats. Key areas affected include banking, healthcare, and government sectors, which are frequently targeted due to the sensitive nature of the data they handle. To combat these risks, there is an increasing focus on public awareness, cybersecurity education, and robust regulatory frameworks. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of cybercrime, with a focus on developing innovative prevention strategies, strengthening internal security protocols, and classifying key cybercrime terminologies to better understand their implications for digital infrastructure.",International Journal of Science and Research Archive,0,0,10.30574/ijsra.2024.13.1.1919,https://doi.org/10.30574/ijsra.2024.13.1.1919,,FALSE,,a72842ba6f4597fdd9df46c112e2ca4c19d1a046,

Small-to-medium enterprise owners working from home were more likely to be victims. Respondents who had experienced recent increases in financial stress and gambling and negative impacts on interpersonal relationships during the COVID-19 pandemic were also more likely to be a victim of cybercrime.

Purpose
Cybercrime is a prevalent and serious threat to publicly traded companies. Defending company information systems from cybercrime is one of the most important aspects of technology management. Cybercrime often not only results in stolen assets and lost business but also damages a company’s reputation, which in turn may affect the company’s stock market value. This is a serious concern to company managers, financial analysts, investors and creditors. This paper aims to examine the impact of cybercrime on stock prices of a sample of publicly traded companies.


Design/methodology/approach
Financial data were gathered on companies that were reported in news stories as victims of cybercrime. The market price of the company’s stock was recorded for several days before the news report and several days after. The percentage change in the stock price was compared to the change in the Dow Jones Industrial average to determine whether the stock price increased or decreased along with the rest of the market.


Findings
Stock prices were negatively affected in all time periods examined, significantly so in one period.


Practical implications
This paper describes cases concerning cybercrime, thereby bringing attention to the value of cybersecurity in protecting computers, identity and transactions. Cyber security is necessary to avoid becoming a victim of cybercrime. Specific security improvements and preventive measures are provided within the paper. Preventive measures are generally less costly than repairs after a cybercrime.


Originality/value
This is an original manuscript that adds to the literature regarding cybercrime and preventive measures.

Blackbourn, Lisa Sugiura, Richard Kapend, Victoria Wang","The reform of the Crime Survey of England and Wales (a national victim survey) has exposed a very high number of individuals who fall victim to computer misuse cybercrimes such as hacking, computer viruses and ransomware. These crimes receive very little attention from the criminal justice system and very few are brought to justice, partly because of the nature of them (global crimes), but also because of a lack of capability among the police. This paper draws on official statistics, an empirical survey and interview research with computer misuse victims. The paper juxtaposes the low priority and lack of resources given to this crime by political and police leaders against many victims’ perceptions and experiences of the crime as equivalent if not more serious than physical counterparts such as burglary, where there is greater interest. The increasing prominence of the virtual world in human life and the impacts of these crimes call for a reappraisal of the official assessment of seriousness in order to raise the priority and increase the capacity of criminal justice towards such offences.",Criminology &amp; Criminal Justice,11,4.4,10.1177/17488958221128128,https://doi.org/10.1177/17488958221128128,,FALSE,,5e3927d647360a60686e60b7c14ff37b20cd5d71,

Yet one area that has received comparatively little attention is fear of cybercrime (Henson and Reyns 2015). This is a surprising omission, with recent evidence suggesting that a substantial proportion of the population may be a victim of online crime each year, and as many as 120,000 new phishing websites appearing each month (APWG 2016). The rapid growth of smart-phone and other handheld computer technology is providing users with almost uninterrupted access to online spaces, and at the same time people are sharing more and more personal information online, placing them at increasing risk of online victimisation. The constantly evolving landscape of cyberspace also represents an increasingly uncertain social space for users, with the possibility that these anxieties will also translate into higher levels of fear of crime. This chapter provides one of the first in depth analyses of fear of cybercrime, using data from a nationally representative survey to identify those individuals that are most fearful, as well as the key drivers of this fear. The link between fear of online and offline crimes is also examined, to determine the extent that people transfer their offline anxieties into the online sphere, or whether fear of cybercrime stands alone.",,7,1,10.4324/9781315651781-8,https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315651781-8,,FALSE,,bcb44c7185cbcbde1ec05ec1423ead15ba41520f,

In this research, an a interpretive study have been carried out to propose a novel Digital Security Management Framework. The main contribution of this study is providing a novel approach by examining the recent recorded threats against individuals, quantifying these threats, and proposing a novel digital risk framework detailing the list of threats and the corresponding risk treatment options tailored for individuals. The scenario of the case study is a family that use personal computers to access banking and investment accounts online, engage in online shopping and also frequently use social media to share artwork and opinions. 17 types of digital risks were identified and the probability of loss and impact of each risk have been quantified using Bernoulli distribution f(L;p). The quantified values were used to prioritise mitigation measures. According to the results, and the proposed framework, suitable treatment option(s) was recommended for each risk.

114,0,The Internet as a Conduit for Criminal Activity,2015,21/10/2015,D. Wall,"While there appears to be a common view that the Internet has had a major impact upon criminality, there is much less consensus as to what that impact has been. Many sources make claims about the prevalence of cybercrimes (networked computer crime) without clarifying what is precisely the issue at hand. Indeed, when so-called cases of cybercrime come to court they often have the familiar ring of the 'traditional' rather than the 'cyber' about them. Fraud, pornography, paedophilia, etc., are already covered by substantive areas of law in most jurisdictions. Even more confusing is the gap between the many hundreds of thousands of estimated incidents and the relatively small number of known prosecutions - which questions the early predictions that cybercrimes, unless checked, could effectively bring criminals into every home. In fact, the confusion has led some authors to question whether or not there are indeed such things as cybercrimes (Brenner, 2001:1). Others, have questioned whether cybercrimes are actually categories of crime in need of new theory or whether they are better understood by existing theories (Jones, 2003:98). These contrasting viewpoints expose a large gap in our understanding and beg a number of questions. Are, for example, our concerns about cybercrime driven solely by the media sensitisation of one or two novel events and effectively fabricated into a crime wave. Or are the dramatic news stories the product of information sources created by the cyber-security industry which has a vested interest in sensationalising cybercrimes.

115,0,INFORMATION CRIMES AND INVESTIGATION CHALLENGE COMBATING INFORMATION CRIMES; A MULTIDIMENSIONAL APPROACH TO ADDRESSING INVESTIGATION CHALLENGES IN THE ERA OF DIGITAL ADVANCEMENT,2024,29/11/2024,Prusha Qalandar Hussein,"In our increasingly digitized world, information crimes have emerged as a significant threat, encompassing a wide range of unlawful activities such as hacking, identity theft, and cyber espionage. This study explores the landscape of information crimes and the challenges faced by investigators in addressing and mitigating these offenses. The first aspect of this study examines the diverse realm of information crimes, providing an overview of the types of offenses that fall under this category. From financial fraud to data breaches, the spectrum of information crimes is vast, posing risks to individuals, businesses, and even nations. Understanding the nature and evolution of these crimes is crucial for developing effective investigation strategies and procedures. The second focus of this study is on the challenges faced by investigators when tackling information crimes. The dynamic and borderless nature of the digital realm presents unique obstacles, including issues related to jurisdiction, attribution, and the rapidly evolving tactics employed by cybercriminals.

 Additionally, the study sheds light on the technological complexities that investigators face, such as encryption and anonymization tools that perpetrators exploit to conceal their activities. To address these challenges, the study suggests the implementation of multidimensional and collaborative approaches. International cooperation among law enforcement agencies, private sector entities, and cybersecurity experts is emphasized. The study also seeks continuous training and skill development for investigators to stay abreast of technological advancements. In conclusion, this paper tries to underscore the urgency of enhancing global efforts to combat information crimes. By comprehensively understanding the landscape of these offenses and addressing the specific challenges faced by investigators, we can better equip ourselves to safeguard the integrity of information in our interconnected world.",ZANKO Journal of Law and Politics,0,0,10.21271/zjlp.22.sp.23,https://doi.org/10.21271/zjlp.22.sp.23,,FALSE,,6b7885a35cd120e19e6eed1bdc3df8b5edd99284,

Kakeshov","Globalisation is a reason for increasing levels of anxiety, physical fatigue, and psychological problems, which weakens the ability of people to resist encroachment on themselves, especially in the Internet environment – the dominant sphere for communication. The study aims to identify the vectors of interaction between the state and potential victims of crime on the Internet by analysing the activities of the subjects of the direction in countries with different scientific and technical potentials. The study employed statistical methods to collect qualitative and quantitative indicators of the issue under consideration, as well as comparative analysis to compare the elements of state policy in the field of combating cybercrime. The intensity of crimes committed with the help of Internet tools is growing every year and it is primarily due to the growth of opportunities to perform various financial, social and other types of interaction in the online space. However, there is a direct correlation between the number of cybercrimes and the level of scientific and technological development of a country. According to the Global Innovation Index, some of the most innovatively developed countries are the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Japan, where the intensity of scientific progress is several times higher than in less developed countries, for example, in the Central Asian region. The role and place of state bodies concerning the prevention of Internet crime is extremely difficult to overestimate because it is the central and local government that has a leading position in the development of preventive measures to prevent and minimise the phenomenon of victimisation of society in the Internet space. The distinction and understanding of the types and directions of crimes in the online environment is necessary to create an effective mechanism to combat such crimes and to develop effective tools to inculcate a healthy lifestyle to prevent the development of victimisation traits in a person.

The latest survey, undertaken in May 2016, covered just under 10,000 respondents. Findings from the survey confirm that criminal misuse of personal information continues to occur in Australia. Around 20 percent of respondents have had their personal information misused over their lifetime, with between eight and nine percent experiencing misuse in the 12 months prior to completing the survey. Identity crime is one of the most prevalent forms of criminal activity in Australia and remains a persistent concern for many Australians.

Wall,"The Internet and the criminal behaviour it transforms (cybercrime) pose considerable challenges for order maintenance and law enforcement because Internet‐related offending takes place within a global context while crime tends to be nationally defined. Policing cybercrime is made all the more complex by the very nature of policing and security being networked and nodal and also because within this framework the public police play only a small part in the policing of the Internet. In this paper it is argued that the future of the public police role in policing the Internet is more than simply acquiring new knowledge and capacity, but it is about forging new relationships with the other nodes within the networks of Internet security. These relationships require a range of transformations to take place in order to enhance the effectiveness and legitimacy of the nodal architecture. It will then be argued that some of the contradictions faced by ‘the police’ are being reconciled by the gradual reconstitution of a neo‐Peelian paradigm across a global span, which brings with it a range of instrumental and normative challenges.",Police Practice and Research,135,7.5,10.1080/15614260701377729,https://doi.org/10.1080/15614260701377729,,FALSE,,3d1cec772dc38646e726d3d9c8647a9c3c3fb505,

This research paper engages analysis of the cybercrimes that target individuals on the internet and also examines the motivation of criminals that perform such attacks which include (e. g phishing, scams), online harassment, identity theft, malware, hacking and denial-of-service crimes. Cybercrime is a threat to today’s internet-dependent society and is a huge growing problem. By research, it is found that people are using online banking, online shopping and online social networking. Digital technology provides benefits and it provides a rich environment for criminal activity to steal an identity to the theft of classified government information, also known as hacking. A few short examples include buying and selling illegal software and malware, hacking of servers, corrupting systems that could cost billions to individuals, organizations, and government. Cybercrime refers to any crime performed using a computer or an electronic device, mainly through the Internet. As the Internet has many opportunities to consume and access information. Cyber-attacks have mainly caused damage to banking using a credit card and payment scams. Remember, while working within a business, each person has to take personal responsibility for ensuring cybersecurity. You have to prioritize risks that are likely to affect and team up to create the strongest defence against cyberattacks. The study identified security measures are required as well as knowledge of the potential dangers of the Internet. Various steps are taken to slow down attacks but unfortunately are not able to achieve success. The reasons for cyber-attacks, 1.Countries having weak cyber securities, 2. Criminals use new technologies to attack, 3. Cybercrime with business schemes. Every human being is connected by using the internet and it makes the world small.

126,0,Degrees of Ignorance About the Costs of Data Breaches: What Policymakers Can and Can't Do About the Lack of Good Empirical Data,2017,31/03/2017,"Josephine Wolff, W. Lehr","Estimates of the costs incurred by a data breach can vary enormously. For instance, a 2015 Congressional Research Service report titled “The Target and Other Financial Data Breaches: Frequently Asked Questions” compiled seven different sources’ estimates of the total losses resulting from the 2013 Target breach, ranging from $11 million to $4.9 billion. The high degree of uncertainty and variability surrounding cost estimates for cybersecurity incidents has serious policy consequences, including making it more difficult to foster robust insurance markets for these risks as well as to make decisions about the appropriate level of investment in security controls and defensive interventions. Multiple factors contribute to the poor data quality, including that cybercrime is continuously evolving, cyber criminals succeed by covering their tracks and victims often see more risk than benefit in sharing information. Moreover, the data that does exist is often criticized for an over-reliance on self-reported survey data and the tendency of many security firms to overestimate the costs associated with security breaches in an effort to further promote their own products and services. 
While the general lack of good cost data presents a significant impediment to informed decision-making, ignorance of the economic impacts of data breaches varies across categories of costs, events, and stakeholders. Moreover, the need for precision, accuracy, or concurrence in data estimates varies depending on the specific decisions the data is intended to inform. Our overarching goals in this paper are to clarify which types of cybersecurity cost data are more easily collected than others; how policymakers might improve data access and why previous policy-based efforts to do so have largely failed; and what differential ignorance implies for cybersecurity policy and investment in cyber defenses and mitigation. 
Our prognosis is that important data gaps, especially as those relate to the $-impacts of cybercrime, including data breaches, will endure and are not fully solvable. Certain cost categories are relatively easily estimated, while others will forever remain difficult if not impossible to estimate precisely. Furthermore, much of the best data that will exist will in the hands of Information Security (InfoSec) and Cybersecurity Insurance (CyberIns) providers and will remain private. We do not view this as a problem in need of correction; however, we do see a role for government in helping make some of this cybersecurity market intelligence data available to other market participants. Although data gaps for publicly available data will continue to remain severe, in many cases, this will not be an impediment to evidence-based decision-making so long as the government can encourage a flow of good third-party research.",Social Science Research Network,14,1.7,10.2139/SSRN.2943867,https://doi.org/10.2139/SSRN.2943867,,FALSE,,d1a056816f59e5093bb172d0afc494bf3e73d736,

Levi,"The definition, harmfulness, incidence and prevalence of computer-related crime continue to be controversial. The unifying theme around cyber-crime as an issue seldom amounts to more than a claim to be late or post-modern. Sceptics traditionally argue that much of what is described as computer crime is crime that would not have been significantly harder had computers never been invented but although, as I shall argue, that may be true of conceptual categories such as trespass, theft, obscenity and violence (Wall, 1998: 203), it is undoubtedly true that computers – and especially the Internet democratise criminal opportunities by opening up the possibility of virtual access to sites such as financial and defence systems that would not be available physically to many offenders. (For an excellent introduction to this aspect, see Mann and Sutton, 1998.) Even if we were to agree on a definition of the phenomenon, given non-reporting and even when reported the difficulty of fitting the crime to existing legal categories, our understanding of when and where ‘it’ occurs is very limited. Indeed, Wall (1998: 203) goes so far as to assert that ""it is ...too early even to attempt an assessment of the extent of cybervictimization, indeed, there are many good reasons as to why this might never be possible."" Whilst I agree that this is so in the round, this paper sketches out some brief perspective on the emergence of computer fraud as a social issue and then goes on to examine what surveys to date tell us about its incidence and prevalence. I will not examine what the legal implications of this are, because there is no reason why the legal framework of fraud and attempted fraud should not cope adequately, though evidential issues may be far from easy.",,19,0.8,10.4324/9780203164501_CHAPTER_4,https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203164501_CHAPTER_4,,FALSE,,7335e5af85a21c4bc1c579cd19bdc66b8c18cb25,

Individuals who have experienced victimization in the past are fearful of cybercrime. Yet, despite the increase in diversified cybercrime, previous studies have used inaccurate, aggregated measures of victimization and fear. This study uses domain-specific cybercrime victimization and fear measures to clarify the relationships between the two. We further investigate how the level of informed risk of cybercrime, which is fundamental to creating effective policies for combating cybercrime, moderates such associations. Utilizing the 2019 Eurobarometer (N = 20,400, country N = 28), we conducted a separate analysis for each of the 10 types of cybercrime. As expected, a multilevel regression analysis revealed that victims are more likely to fear a type of cybercrime that they have experienced before. More interestingly, such associations are statistically significant for specific types of cybercrime depending on the level of informed risk. Based on these findings, we discuss policy implications for developing and revising campaigns and educational programs for cybercrime victims and the general public and increasing international institutional cooperation.",Criminal Justice Studies,3,1.7,10.1080/1478601X.2023.2254099,https://doi.org/10.1080/1478601X.2023.2254099,,FALSE,,7f92fd25f46b24445910ea4544755a858ef80236,

That's a 300 percent increase over 2015, where 1,000 ransomware attacks were seen per day. Cyber criminals are successfully penetrating even the most high-profile companies and governmental agencies. The breach at the NSA was truly alarming and just one recent example of the dire situation the country, and world, face as cybercrime intensifies and the cyber security talent shortage becomes more serious. Accordingly, the purpose of this research is to focus on cyber education at the national, government, and law enforcement level examining the methodology to set the tone from the top ensuring alignment between governments, law enforcers, private sector, and academic level. It also examines the gaps in cyber laws and educational governance initiatives and their impact on efficient execution of cyber policies for various regions of the world with a focus on the United Arab Emirates and the United States of America. Finally, this article recommends policy guidelines and a compliance manual framework for governments and law enforcers to consider ensuring that cyber risks are properly addressed and mitigated in a structured and coherent way.",International Journal of Legal Information,4,0.6,10.1017/jli.2019.22,https://doi.org/10.1017/jli.2019.22,,FALSE,,3677e58211122ecff779bebdcb1451794b070747,
135,0,Exploring the impact of cyber and traditional crime victimization: Impact comparisons and explanatory factors,2024,08/10/2024,"Jildau Borwell, Jurjen Jansen, Wouter Stol","As cybercrime victimization rates continue to rise, our understanding of their impact, especially compared to traditional crime, remains limited. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted surveys among 910 crime victims, measuring the impact of cyber and traditional variants of property, person-centered, and sexual crime. We compared the impact of: (1) residential burglary and hacking of online bank accounts; (2) doorstep deception and bank helpdesk fraud; (3) in-person threats and online threats; and (4) sexual assault and image-based sexual abuse. Impact was categorized into peritraumatic stress, internalizing problems, externalizing problems, financial impact, and damaged self-image. Our findings reveal that cybercrime impact mostly equals or exceeds that of traditional crimes. Disparities especially emerge in terms of higher peritraumatic stress experienced by victims of cyber property crime, and more damage to self-image suffered by victims of both cyber property and cyber sexual crimes. Furthermore, we identified significant determinants of victim impact among crime characteristics, and social, personal, and demographic factors, some varying between cyber and traditional crime. Our study emphasizes the implications of the technological nature of cybercrime and the relatively active role played by cybercrime victims, while also considering the issue of victim blaming. Furthermore, we underscore the need for targeted victim support and prioritization of cybercrime.",International Review of Victimology,1,2.1,10.1177/02697580241282782,https://doi.org/10.1177/02697580241282782,,FALSE,,92dd7bed5f86daae1a023958db23d31a504fc4dc,
136,0,The effect of prevalence and its interaction with sample size on the reliability of species distribution models,2009,21/12/2009,"A. Jiménez‐Valverde, J. Lobo, Joaquín Hortal","Prevalence (the presence/absence ratio in the training data) is commonly thought to influence the reliability of the predictions of species distribution models. However, little is known about its precise impact. We studied its effects using a virtual species, avoiding the presence of unaccounted-for effects in the modeling process (false absences, non-explanatory predictors, etc.). We sampled the distribution of the virtual species to obtain several data subsets of varying sample size and prevalence, and then modeled these data subsets using logistic regressions. Our results show that model predictions can be highly accurate over a wide range of sample sizes and prevalence scores, provided that the predictors are truly related to the distribution of the species and the training data are reliable. The effect of sample size becomes apparent for datasets of less than 70 data points, and the effect of prevalence is significant only for datasets with extremely unbalanced samples ( 0.99). There is also a strong interaction between sample size and prevalence, indicating that the most negative factor is the sample size of each event (absence and/or presence), and not biased prevalence, as previously thought. We suggest that, in the real world, an interaction must exist between the sample size of each event and the quality of the training data. We discuss that biased prevalences can be a desirable property of the data, instead of a problem to be avoided, also pointing out the importance of using the best absence data possible when modeling the distribution of species of narrow geographic range.",Community Ecology,120,7.9,10.1556/COMEC.10.2009.2.9,https://doi.org/10.1556/COMEC.10.2009.2.9,,FALSE,,e03bb5494a701b90caa88f8ae752244dc9434e1b,

138,0,Understanding Cybercrime Offending and Victimization Patterns from a Global Perspective,2022,01/03/2022,J. R. Lee,"
 Cybercrime research within criminology and criminal justice sciences has increased over the past few decades, improving the knowledge and evidence-base around cybercrime offending and victimization generally. While earlier cybercrime studies were based primarily in the United States, there has been a recent surge in studies using international samples and multidisciplinary approaches to understand cybercrime patterns. The current issue of the International Journal of Cybersecurity Intelligence and Cybercrime consists of four articles that seek to advance our understanding of cybercrime behaviors from a global perspective. To that end, the objective of this paper is to provide a brief overview of the articles included in this issue. The overview will comprise a summary report of each study’s objectives, main findings, and implications. Exploring cybercrime from an international perspective underscores both the global nature of the phenomena and the need to form deeper insights into its unique properties.

139,0,Cardiovascular health metrics and prevalence of cardiovascular disease in the Republic of Moldova,2020,01/09/2020,"E. Raevschi, B. C. Martin","
 
 
 Achieving and maintaining cardiovascular health of individuals has a significant impact on reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality at the population level.
 
 
 
 We performed a cross-sectional community survey of 2,612 adult respondents in the Republic of Moldova. The American Heart Association cardiovascular health metrics score was used in total and by its two components: (1) health factors (blood pressure, total cholesterol, glucose, body mass index); (2) health behaviors (nonsmoking, physical activity, healthy diet score). The prevalence of CVD was identified as the main outcome measure.
 
 
 
 The prevalence of CVD was lower in study participants having all 7 cardiovascular health metrics (14.7%; 95% CI, 2.8% to 26.6%) compared to those with 0 to 1 cardiovascular health metrics (78.2%; 95% CI, 67.3% to 89.1%). Among participants who met all health factor metrics, the prevalence of CVD was lower (15.1%; 95% CI, 5.5% to 24.7%) compared to those with 0 to 1 health factor metrics (72.5 %; 95% CI, 69.9% to 75.0%). Study respondents who engaged in all health behaviors and those who engaged in 0 to 1 health behaviors had a similarly high prevalence of CVD (60.1%; 95% CI, 57.4% to 62.8% and 60.4%; 95% CI, 55.3% to 65.4%, respectively).
 
 
 
 Lower prevalence of CVD was related to a greater total score of cardiovascular health metrics and with health factor components. While those diagnosed CVD appear willing to improve their behaviors, the population at risk is not likely to engage in health behaviors to prevent the onset of CVD.
 
 
 
 Increasing individual’s responsibility in addressing their own health implies improvement of community health. Strategies for health promotion should focus more on an individual’s motivation to assume personal responsibility for behaviors affecting their health.

140,0,Mafias on the Move: How Organized Crime Conquers New Territories,2011,20/02/2011,Federico Varese,"Organized crime is spreading like a global virus as mobs take advantage of open borders to establish local franchises at will. That at least is the fear, inspired by stories of Russian mobsters in New York, Chinese triads in London, and Italian mafias throughout the West. As Federico Varese explains in this compelling and daring book, the truth is more complicated. Varese has spent years researching mafia groups in Italy, Russia, the United States, and China, and argues that mafiosi often find themselves abroad against their will, rather than through a strategic plan to colonize new territories. Once there, they do not always succeed in establishing themselves. Varese spells out the conditions that lead to their long-term success, namely sudden market expansion that is neither exploited by local rivals nor blocked by authorities. Ultimately the inability of the state to govern economic transformations gives mafias their opportunity. In a series of matched comparisons, Varese charts the attempts of the Calabrese 'Ndrangheta to move to the north of Italy, and shows how the Sicilian mafia expanded to early twentieth-century New York, but failed around the same time to find a niche in Argentina. He explains why the Russian mafia failed to penetrate Rome but succeeded in Hungary. In a pioneering chapter on China, he examines the challenges that triads from Taiwan and Hong Kong find in branching out to the mainland. Based on ground-breaking field work and filled with dramatic stories, this book is both a compelling read and a sober assessment of the risks posed by globalization and immigration for the spread of mafias.",,207,14.7,10.5860/choice.49-0592,https://doi.org/10.5860/choice.49-0592,,FALSE,,08cc25c2dea63c4ab36f5b46316dee9f71e63434,

Through these discussions, we aspire to highlight the existing knowledge base for discussions of crime within HCI, provide a space for sharing researcher's personal experiences in their work with and against crime, and highlight best practice going forwards. We will do this by using three considerations to inform our critical focus on crime: (1) mapping out the existing ways that HCI has addressed crime; (2) considering what part crime plays in approaches to social justice; (3) questioning who is thus morally responsible for the criminal activity of others, and what does this entail for ensuring fair approaches within technical design.",Extended Abstracts of the 2020 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,4,0.8,10.1145/3334480.3375176,https://doi.org/10.1145/3334480.3375176,,FALSE,,b783f4037cf8d54ecf048c3c1f0e798e52145e8a,

144,0,Assessing Cybersecurity Policy Effectiveness in Africa via a Cybersecurity Liability Index,2018,16/03/2018,"Kwasi Adomako, Nabeel Mohamed, A. Garba, Martin Saint","Africa is a continent of approximately 1.24 billion people, yet it is estimated that there are only 7,000 certified security professionals, or one for every 177,000 people. Africa's information and communications technology (ICT) sector grew by 7,000 percent between 2000 and 2016, with Internet penetration increasing to nearly 28%. The use of ICT, and in particular the Internet, has become a matter of strategic importance. Not only do these technologies spur economic development, but they also improve productivity, efficiency, and innovation across the continent, and encourage the free flow of ideas and information. The rapid growth of the Internet has also created new opportunities for perpetrating cybercrime, which costs African economies an estimated total of over one billion US dollars every year. Once considered a trivial matter in Africa, cybercrime is now identified as a significant barrier to development. With African nations increasingly aware of the issue, they are starting to take legislative and regulatory steps to counter the rising trend of cyber attacks. However, as of 2016, only 11 out of 54 African countries have enacted specific laws against cybercrime. Another 12 countries have partial laws, and 30 have no meaningful cyber-crime laws. There is no global consensus on how to regulate and respond to cyberattacks; therefore, African countries tend to adopt policies and laws intended for developed nations that possess much higher response capabilities. Even countries with cybercrime laws remain vulnerable as efforts to date have been mostly ineffective in preventing or prosecuting attacks. The goal of this paper is to provide insight regarding the current cybersecurity status in six representative countries in Africa that have enacted laws against cybercrime. Particularly, to investigate why security policy frameworks and legislation in these countries currently have had little or no impact on preventing cybercrime. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods are used. These methods aim to identify and review the implementation of cybersecurity policies and relevant literature relating to security in each of these countries. The following key performance indicators (KPIs) are measured and analyzed for each country in the study: - The existence of computer emergency response teams (CERTs). - Threat landscape identification. - The existence of cybercrime legislation. - The number of security professionals. - Security breach notifications. - Conviction rates for cybercriminals. - Accession to the Budapest convention. The quantitative evaluation is based on analyzing statistical data related to cybersecurity incidents to: - Measure the cost of cybercrime before and after legislation. - Quantify the impact of cybersecurity legislation and policies. - Develop a security index based on KPIs. - Perform a sensitivity analysis to measure the impact of KPIs on legislation. We use these measures to construct a Cybersecurity Liability Index (CLI) using an additive utility function. A swing-weighting approach is used to design the CLI, where individual attributes are compared to other alternatives with a goal of quantifying the KPIs. The findings and results of this analysis form the foundation to provide policy recommendations to improve existing regulatory infrastructures and guide countries that have not yet adopted relevant legislation.",Social Science Research Network,5,0.7,10.2139/ssrn.3142296,https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3142296,,FALSE,,0a9dddf32e6945b7b54866b04a17c5d37ea59122,
